# V3 Guidelines


## Common Field Names
- `uid` - Unique identifier (readonly)
- `business_uid` - Reference to business
- `created_at` / `updated_at` - Timestamps (ISO 8601, format: date-time) (readonly)

## Readonly Fields
- Backend-managed fields (`uid`, `created_at`, `updated_at`) appear in entities but NOT in request schemas
- Don't use `readOnly` array at root level - instead, simply omit readonly fields from request schemas

## Description Standards
- All field names use **snake_case**
- Include inline examples in descriptions: `(e.g., "12127654321")`
- Enum values should have detailed explanations of what each value means
- Token permissions in bold at the end of endpoint descriptions: `Available for **Staff and Directory tokens**`
- Descriptions should be detailed and elaborate - don't save space, clarity is more important

## Array Fields
- Use `uniqueItems: true` when array items must be unique
