# V3 Guidelines


## Common Field Names
- `uid` - Unique identifier (readonly)
- `business_uid` - Reference to business
- `created_at` / `updated_at` - Timestamps (ISO 8601, format: date-time) (readonly)

## Readonly Fields
- Backend-managed fields (`uid`, `created_at`, `updated_at`) appear in entities but NOT in request schemas
- Mark readonly fields in entities with `"readOnly": true` on the property level
- Additionally, omit readonly fields from request schemas (belt and suspenders approach)

Example in entity:
```json
"uid": {
  "type": "string",
  "readOnly": true,
  "description": "Unique identifier for the record."
}
```

## Description Standards
- All field names use **snake_case**
- Include inline examples in descriptions: `(e.g., "12127654321")`
- Enum values should have detailed explanations of what each value means
- Token permissions in bold at the end of endpoint descriptions: `Available for **Staff and Directory tokens**`
- Use the term "Internal Token" when documenting "Admin tokens"
- Descriptions should be detailed and elaborate - don't save space, clarity is more important

## Array Fields
- Use `uniqueItems: true` when array items must be unique

## Tokens
Only allow the following tokens to be documented:
- Directory
- Staff
- Application
- Internal
- Client

Internal is our documentation for Admin token
Staff is sometimes mentioned in the code as Application User
Directory is sometimes mentioned in the code as Applications
