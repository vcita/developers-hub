# Entity v3 Standards
## Standards must be followed!
## When developing an Entity defention, follow the standars listed on our confluence: @https://myvcita.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/IT/pages/3774808305/Entities+v3+Standards

## File Structure
- Entities: `entities/{domain}/{entityName}.json`

## Entity JSON Structure
- Root level must have: `type`, `properties`, `description`, `example`
- Examples must be complete and realistic with all fields populated

## Avoid
- Don't use `readOnly` array at root level - not a common pattern
- Don't add validation patterns too restrictive for international use
- Backend-managed fields may be in entity but not in request schemas
