# Workflow Skip Policy

## Never Suggest Skip

When creating or updating API validation workflow files:

1. **NEVER** add `onFail: skip` to workflow steps
2. **NEVER** set `skipReason` in workflow index entries
3. **NEVER** suggest skipping a test as a solution

Skip decisions are **human-only** decisions. The AI should always attempt to make the test work by:
- Adding all necessary prerequisite steps
- Documenting the full happy path
- Including all required parameters and their sources

## Instead of Skip

When an endpoint is difficult to test:
1. Add prerequisite steps to fetch required dynamic data
2. Document the full flow needed to make it work
3. Add Known Issues section explaining limitations
4. Let humans decide if/when to skip

## Workflow Structure

Every workflow should aim for a complete happy path:
```yaml
steps:
  - id: step_1
    description: First prerequisite
    # ... full step definition
    onFail: stop  # NOT skip - fail the test if prerequisite fails
```
