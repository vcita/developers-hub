# API Documentation Fix Report Handler

When processing ai-fixes.md validation reports, use this rule to fix all documentation issues.

## MANDATORY: CREATE A PLAN BEFORE EXECUTION

Before making ANY changes, you MUST create a detailed plan using the CreatePlan tool.

### Plan Creation Steps

1. **Read the ENTIRE report** - Parse the JSON section to get all issues
2. **Identify root causes** - Most failures are caused by:
   - Missing workflow files (test runner sends empty body `{}`)
   - Workflows missing required query parameters
   - Workflows with incorrect/placeholder test data
   - **Validate your findings with the source code**
3. **Compare each issue with the test log** - Understand WHY it failed
4. **Verify each fix will produce 2xx result** - Don't just document errors
5. **Create the plan** with these sections:

### Required Plan Structure

```markdown
# Fix {Domain} API Documentation Issues

## Report Summary
- Total Issues: X
- Endpoints Tested: X
- Passed: X
- Failed: X
- Warnings: X

## Root Cause Analysis
[Explain the main causes of failures - usually missing/incomplete workflows]

## Priority 1: Create Missing Workflow Files
[List endpoints that have NO workflow file - these fail because empty body is sent]
- Endpoint: POST /path
- File to create: api-validation/workflows/{domain}/filename.md
- Required body: {"field": "value"}
- Expected result: 2xx

## Priority 2: Fix Existing Workflows
[List workflows that exist but have incorrect/missing data]
- Endpoint: GET /path
- File: existing-workflow.md
- Problem: Missing query parameter
- Fix: Add ?param={{param}} to path
- Expected result: 2xx

## Priority 3: Swagger Schema Fixes
[Mark required fields to prevent future empty body tests]
- File: swagger/domain/file.json
- Endpoint: POST /path
- Fix: Add "required": true to body; add "required": ["field"]

## Priority 4: Warning-Level Issues
[x-reference-to annotations - don't block 2xx]

## Skip / No Action Needed
[False positives, infrastructure issues, tooling issues]

## Summary - Files to Create/Modify
### New Workflow Files (count)
### Workflow Files to Fix (count)
### Swagger Files to Update (count)
```

## GOAL: GET 2XX RESULTS FIRST

The primary goal is to make tests PASS (return 2xx), NOT to document errors.

### Root Cause: Missing/Incomplete Workflows

**Most failures occur because:**
1. **No workflow file exists** → Test runner sends empty body `{}` → 500 error
2. **Workflow missing query params** → Required param not sent → 400/422 error
3. **Workflow has placeholder data** → Invalid UID/values → 422 error

### How to Identify Root Cause

| Error Pattern | Root Cause | Fix |
|--------------|------------|-----|
| 500 on empty body | No workflow file exists | Create workflow with valid body |
| 500 on missing required field | Workflow sends empty/incomplete body | Add required fields to workflow |
| 422 "param required" | Workflow missing query parameter | Add `?param={{param}}` to path |
| 422 "invalid value" | Workflow has placeholder/fake data | Use real data or dynamic reference |
| 401 Unauthorized | Workflow missing auth query param | Add auth-related param |
| 404 Not Found | UID doesn't exist | Fix UID resolution in workflow |

### Check If Workflow Exists FIRST

Before analyzing any issue:
1. Check if workflow file exists: `api-validation/workflows/{domain}/{endpoint_file}.md`
2. If NO workflow exists → Create one with valid test data
3. If workflow exists → Check if it has all required params/body fields

## NO JIRA TICKETS UNTIL 2XX

**Do NOT create JIRA tickets for:**
- 500 errors from empty bodies (fix: create workflow)
- 500 errors from missing required fields (fix: add to workflow)
- 422 validation errors (fix: correct the test data)
- Any error that can be fixed by providing valid test data

**Assume the endpoint WORKS** - focus on sending correct requests first.

**Only consider JIRA after:**
1. Workflow has valid test data
2. All required params are sent
3. Endpoint STILL fails with proper request
4. Error is verified as actual code bug

## FIX PRIORITY ORDER (STRICT)

### Priority 1: Create Missing Workflows
Endpoints with NO workflow file fail because empty body is sent.

**Check for each failed endpoint:**
```bash
ls api-validation/workflows/{domain}/
# Look for: {method}_{path_with_underscores}.md
```

**Create workflow with:**
```yaml
---
endpoint: "METHOD /path/{param}"
domain: {domain}
tags: []
swagger: swagger/{domain}/file.json
status: pending
---

# {Action} {Resource}

## Summary
{Brief description}

## Prerequisites
{Any setup needed}

## Test Request

```yaml
steps:
  - id: {action}_{resource}
    method: {METHOD}
    path: "/path/{param}"
    body:
      {required_field}: {valid_value}
    expect:
      status: [200, 201]
```
```

### Priority 2: Fix Existing Workflows
Workflows exist but have incorrect/missing data.

**Common fixes:**
- Add missing query parameters to path
- Add missing body fields
- Replace placeholder UIDs with `{{uid}}` references
- Add prerequisite steps for UID resolution

### Priority 3: Swagger Required Fields
After workflows work, mark required fields to prevent future empty body tests.

**Schema fixes:**
```json
{
  "parameters": [{
    "name": "body",
    "in": "body",
    "required": true,
    "schema": {
      "type": "object",
      "required": ["field1", "field2"]
    }
  }]
}
```

### Priority 4: x-reference-to Annotations
Warning-level documentation improvements (don't block 2xx).

## VERIFY FIXES AGAINST TEST LOGS

For each issue in the report:

1. **Read the actual error message** in the report
2. **Identify what request was sent** (body, params)
3. **Determine why it failed**:
   - Empty body? → Create/fix workflow
   - Missing param? → Add to workflow path
   - Invalid value? → Fix workflow data
4. **Confirm your fix will produce 2xx**
5. **Document in plan with expected result**

### Example Analysis

**Report says:** `500 on empty body - note/content not marked required`

**Analysis:**
1. What was sent? Empty body `{}`
2. Why? No workflow file exists for POST /notes
3. Fix: Create workflow with `{"note": {"content": "Test"}}`
4. Expected result: 201 Created

**DO NOT** just add `required` to swagger and call it done - that documents the error but doesn't make the test pass.

## Workflow Files Location
- Path: `api-validation/workflows/{domain}/{endpoint_file}.md`
- Naming: `{method}_{path_with_underscores}.md`
- Example: `post_business_clients_v1_matters_matter_uid_notes.md`

## Signs That a Workflow Fix is Needed

| Error Pattern | Likely Cause | Fix |
|--------------|--------------|-----|
| 500 on any POST/PUT/PATCH | No workflow or empty body | Create workflow with body |
| 422 with "Not Found" on UID | Fake/placeholder UID | Use real UID or `{{uid}}` |
| 422 with "missing" field | Required field not sent | Add field to workflow body |
| 404 on entity lookup | Entity doesn't exist | Add prerequisite to create it |
| 400/422 "required param" | Query param missing | Add to workflow path |

## How to Identify Fake Test Data
- UIDs that look fake: `inv_12345`, `pkg_abc`, `test123`, `example_uid`
- Real UIDs look like: `lk9wgeze3ee1nl1v`, `fc2ca1c54e528bc4`
- If a UID is short, sequential, or contains words like "test/example/sample" → IT'S FAKE

## Allowed Changes
- You are ONLY allowed to change documentation (swagger files, workflow files)
- You are NOT allowed to change application code
- If code fixes are TRULY required (after exhausting all workflow/swagger options AND getting 2xx with valid data fails), create a JIRA ticket in epic: https://myvcita.atlassian.net/browse/VCITA2-11611 using Atlassian MCP

## Processing Flow

### Phase 1: Create Plan (MANDATORY)
1. Read complete ai-fixes.md file
2. Extract ALL issues from JSON section
3. For each failed endpoint:
   - Check if workflow file exists
   - Read the error message to understand root cause
   - Determine fix that will produce 2xx
4. Create plan using CreatePlan tool
5. Wait for user approval before proceeding

### Phase 2: Create Missing Workflows
For each endpoint without a workflow:
1. Create workflow file with valid test data
2. Include all required body fields
3. Include all required query parameters
4. Set expected status to [200, 201]

### Phase 3: Fix Existing Workflows
For workflows with issues:
1. Add missing query parameters to path
2. Add missing body fields
3. Fix placeholder/fake data
4. Add prerequisites for UID resolution

### Phase 4: Swagger Schema Updates
After workflows are ready:
1. Add `required: true` to body parameters
2. Add `required` array to schemas
3. Add `x-reference-to` annotations
4. Add error response schemas

### Phase 5: Generate Reports
- Create `{report-folder}/fix-progress.md`
- Create `{report-folder}/endpoints-to-retest.md`

## Output Requirements

### 1. Progress Tracking File
Create `{report-folder}/fix-progress.md` with:
- Total issues count
- Workflows created count
- Workflows fixed count
- Swagger changes count
- Checklist of every endpoint and its status

### 2. Endpoints to Retest
Create `{report-folder}/endpoints-to-retest.md` with:

**Markdown table:**
| Endpoint | Method | Fix Applied | Expected Result |
|----------|--------|-------------|-----------------|

**Quick Copy section:**
```
METHOD /path, METHOD /path, METHOD /path
```

## Schema Fix Guidelines

When fixing swagger documentation, **fix the JSON Schema itself**:

### DO: Use JSON Schema Properties
```json
{
  "type": "object",
  "required": ["tag"],
  "properties": {
    "tag": {
      "type": "string",
      "minLength": 1,
      "description": "Tag to add to the matter"
    }
  },
  "example": { "tag": "important" }
}
```

### DON'T: Add Redundant Description Text
```
❌ "## Request Body Requirements\nThe request body must include..."
```

## CRITICAL RULES

### Fix Priority (MUST follow this order)
1. **CREATE PLAN FIRST** - Always create and get approval before changes
2. **WORKFLOW FIRST** - Create/fix workflows to get 2xx results
3. **SCHEMA SECOND** - Mark required fields after workflows work
4. **ANNOTATIONS THIRD** - Add x-reference-to (warning level)
5. **JIRA LAST** - Only after 2xx with valid data still fails

### General Rules
1. **NEVER skip an issue** - every single issue must be addressed
2. **NEVER remove an endpoint** - even if it returns 404
3. **NEVER change endpoint paths** - paths are immutable
4. **NEVER create JIRA until 2xx attempt** - fix workflows first
5. **ALWAYS check if workflow exists** - missing workflow = root cause
6. **ALWAYS verify fix produces 2xx** - don't just document errors
7. **ALWAYS read the test log** - understand what request was sent
8. **Swagger Files** - Never alter `mcp_swagger` files (auto-generated). Always use `/swagger` directory

### Skip / No Action Needed Categories
- Gateway fallback issues (infrastructure, not swagger)
- Type mismatch issues (API serialization bugs, not blocking 2xx)
- UID resolution tooling issues (tooling, not swagger)
- False positives (e.g., "missing token docs" when docs exist)

## Completion Criteria

You are NOT done until:
- [ ] Plan created and approved
- [ ] Every missing workflow file created
- [ ] Every existing workflow fixed
- [ ] Swagger required fields marked
- [ ] fix-progress.md shows 100% completion
- [ ] endpoints-to-retest.md generated
- [ ] All fixes verified to produce 2xx (in theory)

**If you find yourself wanting to skip something or stop early - DON'T. Go back and continue processing.**
