## Use Case Analysis & Implementation Rules

### 1. SmartSlots for High Cancellation/Irregular Bookings
**Feasibility: ✅ HIGH**

**AI Rules:**
```javascript
Rule 1: High Cancellation Rate
- Filter: Businesses with >25% cancellation rate in last 90 days
- Calculation: (cancelled_appointments / total_appointments) > 0.25
- Time window: Rolling 90-day period
- Minimum threshold: >10 appointments for statistical significance

Rule 2: High No-Show Rate  
- Filter: Businesses with >15% no-show rate in last 60 days
- Calculation: (no_show_appointments / scheduled_appointments) > 0.15
- Additional factor: Irregular booking patterns (high variance in booking intervals)

Rule 3: Irregular Time-Sensitive Services
- Filter: Services with duration <60 minutes AND high cancellation variance
- Target: Healthcare, beauty, consultation services
- Trigger: Monthly checkups, routine appointments with >20% irregular patterns
```

**Reasoning:** SmartSlots would help businesses with unpredictable schedules by optimizing slot allocation and reducing gaps caused by cancellations.

### 2. PickMyCall (AI Receptionist) for High Unanswered Calls
**Feasibility: ✅ HIGH**

**AI Rules:**
```javascript
Rule 1: High Missed Call Rate
- Filter: Businesses with >30% missed calls in last 30 days
- Calculation: (missed_calls / total_inbound_calls) > 0.30
- Minimum volume: >20 calls per month for relevance

Rule 2: Peak Hour Overload
- Filter: Businesses with consistent missed calls during business hours
- Analysis: Identify 2-3 hour windows with >50% missed call rate
- Pattern: Recurring daily/weekly patterns of staff unavailability

Rule 3: Small Team, High Volume
- Filter: Businesses with ≤3 active staff AND >100 calls/month
- Calculation: missed_calls_per_staff_member > 10 per month
- Focus: Service businesses where every call is revenue-critical
```

**Reasoning:** AI receptionist would capture leads and provide 24/7 availability for businesses struggling with call volume management.

### 3. Premium Employment Insurance for 5+ Employee Businesses
**Feasibility: ⚠️ MEDIUM**

**AI Rules:**
```javascript
Rule 1: 5th Staff Member Trigger
- Filter: Businesses where active_staff_count = 5 AND recent addition
- Trigger: New staff member added in last 30 days bringing total to 5+
- Business maturity: >1 year (excludes very new businesses)

Rule 2: Rapid Growth Pattern
- Filter: Businesses with 20%+ staff growth in 6 months AND total ≥4 staff
- Calculation: (current_staff - staff_6_months_ago) / staff_6_months_ago > 0.20
- Target: Growing businesses likely to need expanded coverage

Rule 3: Business Category + Size
- Filter: Professional services with 5+ staff in regulated industries
- Categories: Healthcare, Legal, Financial Services, Consulting
- Additional factor: Business maturity >2 years
```

**Data Gaps:**
- Employee vs. contractor classification
- Current insurance coverage status
- Industry-specific compliance requirements

**Reasoning:** Growing businesses with 5+ team members often face increased liability and need professional insurance coverage.

### 4. Additional User Licenses for New Staff Additions
**Feasibility: ✅ HIGH**

**AI Rules:**
```javascript
Rule 1: New Staff Member Added
- Trigger: New staff member created in last 7 days
- Filter: Businesses with existing partner app subscriptions
- Cross-reference: Current license count vs. active staff count
- Opportunity: Immediate upsell for additional seats

Rule 2: License Utilization Threshold
- Filter: Businesses using >80% of current license capacity
- Calculation: active_staff_using_app / total_licenses > 0.80
- Trigger: New staff addition pushes utilization to 100%
- Timing: Proactive outreach before hitting limits

Rule 3: Role-Based License Matching
- Filter: New staff with roles that typically need specific apps
- Mapping: Admin roles → Full licenses, Staff roles → Basic licenses
- Target: SaaS tools, CRM systems, specialized professional software
```

**Reasoning:** New team members immediately create license needs, making this a high-conversion opportunity with clear business justification.

### 5. Quick Loans for Low-Booking Businesses
**Feasibility: ⚠️ MEDIUM-LOW**

**AI Rules:**
```javascript
Rule 1: Booking Volume Decline
- Filter: Businesses with >30% booking decrease vs. previous 3-month average
- Calculation: current_month_bookings < (avg_last_3_months * 0.70)
- Minimum history: 6 months of booking data required
- Exclude: Seasonal businesses (need business category analysis)

Rule 2: Revenue Trend Analysis
- Filter: Businesses with declining revenue AND stable/growing expenses
- Indicators: Overdue payments increasing + current year < last year revenue
- Target: Service businesses dependent on appointment volume

Rule 3: Cash Flow Stress Signals
- Filter: Multiple overdue payments + declining bookings + mature business
- Calculation: overdue_amount > monthly_average_revenue * 0.25
- Business age: >2 years (established businesses, not startups)
```

**Critical Data Gaps:**
- Credit scores and lending eligibility
- Existing debt obligations  
- Bank account information and cash flow
- Business expenses and operating costs
- Collateral and assets

**Enhanced Data Needed:**
- Integration with accounting systems (QuickBooks, etc.)
- Bank account connectivity for cash flow analysis
- Credit bureau integration for risk assessment
- Industry benchmarking data

**Reasoning:** While booking decline can indicate cash flow stress, loan qualification requires much deeper financial data that vCita doesn't currently capture.
