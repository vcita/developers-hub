look at ai.md report, create a plan for fixing all of the issues. note that you are only allowed to change documentation, not code.
if code fixes are required the process should document them and create a jira ticket for them in this epic: https://myvcita.atlassian.net/browse/VCITA2-11611?atlOrigin=eyJpIjoiODdiNWRhMWEwZTkxNDAzMDllNjczMTQwZTI3MjI5YjUiLCJwIjoiaiJ9 
using attlasian mcp.
## flow
- start with fixing the warnings.
- once done with the warning fixes move on to the FAIL and ERROR
- Always check the code for reference before you decide this is JIRA worthy
- Try to workaround code fixes by stating them in the documentation
- Document your work under reports
- for problems that requires pre-configuration (enabling a feature, etc.), document the pre-configuration steps in a seperate report.
- Finally, prepare a list of endpoints that had FAIL or ERROR to be retested. Generate TWO formats:
1. A markdown table with detailed information
2. A **comma-separated list** that can be pasted into the Validator UI's "Paste List" feature

The comma-separated format should be:
```
METHOD /path, METHOD /path, METHOD /path
```

Example:
```
GET /v1/clients, POST /v1/payments, PUT /v1/invoices/{invoice_uid}
```

This list should be included in the `endpoints-to-retest.md` file under a "Quick Copy" section.

## IMPORTANT - CRITICAL
- always prefer swagger/workflow fixes over code fixes. JIRA is your last resort
- never remove an endpoint
- if the warn happened because test did not use real values and instead used test values, change the workflow to use real values
- never change end point path.
- always check your fixes against the code base to ensure they are correct. 
- Even if report concluded a 404 error ENDPOINT-NOT-FOUND, do not assume this is true. Go deeper into the code and find the root cause.
- before adding reference indication to a field make sure in the code that this is really a reference or only a content constraints. for example "country" has no endpoint to get all countries so it can't be used with reference.
