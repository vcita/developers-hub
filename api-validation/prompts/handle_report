look at ai.md report, create a plan for fixing all of the issues. note that you are only allowed to change documentation, not code.
if code fixes are required the process should document them and create a jira ticket for them in this epic: https://myvcita.atlassian.net/browse/VCITA2-11611?atlOrigin=eyJpIjoiODdiNWRhMWEwZTkxNDAzMDllNjczMTQwZTI3MjI5YjUiLCJwIjoiaiJ9 
using attlasian mcp.
- always prefer swagger fixes over code fixes
- never remove an endpoint
- if the warn happened because test did not use real values and instead used test values, change the workflow to use real values
- never change end point path.
- always check your fixes against the code base to ensure they are correct.
- for problems that requires pre-configuration (enabling a feature, etc.), document the pre-configuration steps in a seperate report.

Document your work under reports

Finally, prepare a list of endpoints that had FAIL or ERROR to be retested. Generate TWO formats:
1. A markdown table with detailed information
2. A **comma-separated list** that can be pasted into the Validator UI's "Paste List" feature

The comma-separated format should be:
```
METHOD /path, METHOD /path, METHOD /path
```

Example:
```
GET /v1/clients, POST /v1/payments, PUT /v1/invoices/{invoice_uid}
```

This list should be included in the `endpoints-to-retest.md` file under a "Quick Copy" section.
