# Get Carts

## Summary
Successfully retrieved cart details after creating valid test data. The endpoint requires a valid cart that exists in the system, which was created through the proper workflow of creating a product, product order, and then a cart.

## Prerequisites
No specific prerequisites documented.

## UID Resolution Procedure

How to dynamically obtain required UIDs for this endpoint:

⚠️ **This test requires creating fresh test data to avoid "already exists" errors.**

| UID Field | GET Endpoint | Extract From | Create Fresh | Cleanup |
|-----------|--------------|--------------|--------------|---------|
| cart_uid | - | data.cart.uid | ✓ POST /client/payments/v1/carts | Carts are tied to payment workflows and cleanup through business endpoints would require additional permissions |
| product_id | - | data.product.id | - | - |
| product_order_id | - | data.product_order.id | - | - |

### Resolution Steps

**cart_uid**:
1. **Create fresh test entity**: `POST /client/payments/v1/carts`
   - Body template: `{"cart":{"matter_uid":"{{matter_uid}}","currency":"USD","items":[{"entity_uid":"{{product_order_id}}","entity_type":"ProductOrder"}]}}`
2. Extract UID from creation response: `data.cart.uid`
3. Run the test with this fresh UID
4. **Cleanup note**: Carts are tied to payment workflows and cleanup through business endpoints would require additional permissions

**product_id**:
1. **Create fresh test entity**: `POST /business/payments/v1/products`
   - Body template: `{"product":{"name":"Test Product {{timestamp}}","price":100,"currency":"USD"}}`
2. Extract UID from creation response: `data.product.id`
3. Run the test with this fresh UID

**product_order_id**:
1. **Create fresh test entity**: `POST /business/payments/v1/product_orders`
   - Body template: `{"product_order":{"matter_uid":"{{matter_uid}}","product_id":"{{product_id}}","quantity":1}}`
2. Extract UID from creation response: `data.product_order.id`
3. Run the test with this fresh UID
