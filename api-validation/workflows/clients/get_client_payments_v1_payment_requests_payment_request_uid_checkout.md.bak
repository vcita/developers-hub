# Get Checkout

## Summary
The GET /client/payments/v1/payment_requests/{payment_request_uid}/checkout endpoint works correctly. The original 422 error about coupon functionality was likely due to a specific business configuration at the time of the first test. The endpoint successfully returns checkout session data with HTTP 200, and the response includes is_allowed_coupons: false to indicate coupon functionality status.

## Prerequisites
No specific prerequisites documented.

## UID Resolution Procedure

| UID Field | GET Endpoint | Extract From | Create Fresh | Cleanup |
|-----------|--------------|--------------|--------------|---------|
| payment_request_uid | GET /business/payments/v1/payment_requests | data.payment_requests[0].uid | - | N/A |

### Resolution Steps

**payment_request_uid**:
1. Call `GET /business/payments/v1/payment_requests` with staff token
2. Extract from response: `data.payment_requests[0].uid`
3. Alternative: Call `GET /client/payments/v1/payment_requests?matter_uid={{matter_uid}}` with client token

```json
{
  "payment_request_uid": {
    "source_endpoint": "GET /business/payments/v1/payment_requests",
    "extract_from": "data.payment_requests[0].uid",
    "fallback_endpoint": "GET /client/payments/v1/payment_requests?matter_uid={{matter_uid}}",
    "create_fresh": false,
    "create_endpoint": null,
    "create_body": null,
    "cleanup_endpoint": null,
    "cleanup_note": "Payment requests are business data, do not delete"
  }
}
```

## How to Resolve Parameters
Parameters were resolved automatically.

## Critical Learnings

1. **UID source**: payment_request_uid comes from GET /business/payments/v1/payment_requests (staff token) or GET /client/payments/v1/payment_requests (client token), NOT from /platform/v1/payment/checkout/{url_key}
2. **Module permissions**: Requires payments module to be enabled for the business

## Request Template

Use this template with dynamically resolved UIDs:

```json
{
  "method": "GET",
  "path": "/client/payments/v1/payment_requests/{{resolved.payment_request_uid}}/checkout"
}
```
