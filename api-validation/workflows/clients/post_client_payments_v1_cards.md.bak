## ⚠️ Skip Reason

**This endpoint should be SKIPPED in automated testing.**

This endpoint requires a payment processor to be connected to the business account before cards can be stored. This involves external integrations (Stripe, vcitaPayments, etc.) that cannot be set up through the API alone. The business needs proper payment gateway credentials and configuration.

This is typically due to a business constraint where the endpoint works correctly but cannot be tested repeatedly (e.g., one-time operations, unique constraints).
