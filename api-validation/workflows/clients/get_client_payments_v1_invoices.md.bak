# Get Invoices

## Summary
Test passes successfully. The endpoint requires client token authentication as documented. Using token_type='client' returns HTTP 200 with a valid list of invoices.

## Prerequisites
1. **Client token required**: Must use a client token, not staff/directory token
2. **Payments module**: Business must have Payments module enabled
3. **Portal access**: Client must have portal access enabled (deliverable email, portal settings configured)

## How to Resolve Parameters
Parameters were resolved automatically.

## Critical Learnings

1. **Module permission**: Returns 403 `module_permission_missing` if Payments module is not enabled for the business
2. **Client token acquisition**: Automated client JWT acquisition may fail with 400 if client doesn't have portal access

## Request Template

Use this template with dynamically resolved UIDs:

```json
{
  "method": "GET",
  "path": "/client/payments/v1/invoices",
  "token_type": "client"
