skipReason: This endpoint requires OAuth tokens with application+user binding (per source code: oauth_token with application and resource_owner_id). The authentication model expects 'Token {oauth_token}' format rather than 'Bearer' tokens, and requires specific OAuth application setup that's not accessible through current token acquisition methods.

## Summary
User-approved skip: This endpoint requires OAuth tokens with application+user binding (per source code: oauth_token with application and resource_owner_id). The authentication model expects 'Token {oauth_token}' format rather than 'Bearer' tokens, and requires specific OAuth application setup that's not accessible through current token acquisition methods.

## ⚠️ Skip Reason

**This endpoint should be SKIPPED in automated testing.**

This endpoint requires OAuth tokens with application+user binding (per source code: oauth_token with application and resource_owner_id). The authentication model expects 'Token {oauth_token}' format rather than 'Bearer' tokens, and requires specific OAuth application setup that's not accessible through current token acquisition methods.

This is typically due to a business constraint where the endpoint works correctly but cannot be tested repeatedly (e.g., one-time operations, unique constraints).
