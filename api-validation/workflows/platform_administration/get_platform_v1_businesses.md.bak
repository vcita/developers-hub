# Search Businesses

## Summary
Searches for businesses using filter parameters. This endpoint requires at least one filter query parameter: `email`, `external_id`, or `external_reference_id`. To test successfully, first retrieve the admin email from a known business using the business_uid from config.

## Prerequisites
- Directory token is required
- Config must have `params.business_uid` set to a valid business UID

## UID Resolution

How to dynamically obtain required UIDs for this endpoint:

| UID Field | GET Endpoint | Extract From | Create Fresh | Cleanup |
|-----------|--------------|--------------|--------------|---------|
| email | GET /platform/v1/businesses/{business_uid} | data.business.admin_account.email | No | - |

### Resolution Steps

**email** (query parameter):
1. Use `config.params.business_uid` to get a known business UID (e.g., `00wutb5f1a08a8kn`)
2. Call `GET /platform/v1/businesses/00wutb5f1a08a8kn` with directory token
3. Extract from response: `data.business.admin_account.email`
4. Use the extracted email as the `email` query parameter

```json
{
  "email": {
    "source_endpoint": "GET /platform/v1/businesses/00wutb5f1a08a8kn",
    "extract_from": "data.business.admin_account.email",
    "fallback_endpoint": null,
    "create_fresh": false,
    "create_endpoint": null,
    "create_body": null,
    "cleanup_endpoint": null,
    "cleanup_note": "Use admin email from existing test business"
  }
}
```

## How to Resolve Parameters

**IMPORTANT**: This is a search endpoint that requires valid filter data. Follow these steps:

1. **Get business details first**: Call `GET /platform/v1/businesses/00wutb5f1a08a8kn` (using the test business_uid from config)
2. **Extract admin email**: From the response, get `data.business.admin_account.email`
3. **Call search endpoint**: Use `GET /platform/v1/businesses?email={extracted_email}`

## Critical Learnings

- **Filter required**: The endpoint MUST have at least one filter: `email`, `external_id`, or `external_reference_id`
- **No filter = 400**: Without a filter, returns `400 "No filter specified"`
- **No match = 400**: With a filter but no matching business, returns `400 "No business found"` (not 404!)
- **Two-step resolution**: Must first get valid email from an existing business before searching
- **Directory token only**: This endpoint requires a directory-level token

## Request Template

Use this template with dynamically resolved UIDs:

**Pre-requisite call to get valid email:**
```json
{
  "method": "GET",
  "path": "/platform/v1/businesses/00wutb5f1a08a8kn",
  "purpose": "uid_resolution",
  "extract": "data.business.admin_account.email"
}
```

**Main test call:**
```json
{
  "method": "GET",
  "path": "/platform/v1/businesses?email={{resolved.email}}"
}
```
