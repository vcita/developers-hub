skipReason: This endpoint appears to be documented in swagger but not actually implemented in the codebase. The routes.rb shows 'namespace :operators, only: []' which prevents resources from being created. Additionally, the swagger specifies 'unique_code' field but the actual database model uses 'scope' and 'name' fields.

## Summary
User-approved skip: This endpoint appears to be documented in swagger but not actually implemented in the codebase. The routes.rb shows 'namespace :operators, only: []' which prevents resources from being created. Additionally, the swagger specifies 'unique_code' field but the actual database model uses 'scope' and 'name' fields.

## ⚠️ Skip Reason

**This endpoint should be SKIPPED in automated testing.**

This endpoint appears to be documented in swagger but not actually implemented in the codebase. The routes.rb shows 'namespace :operators, only: []' which prevents resources from being created. Additionally, the swagger specifies 'unique_code' field but the actual database model uses 'scope' and 'name' fields.

This is typically due to a business constraint where the endpoint works correctly but cannot be tested repeatedly (e.g., one-time operations, unique constraints).
