# Get Operator op roles

## Summary
User-approved skip: Infrastructure issue - the operator management service appears to be unavailable in this test environment. All related endpoints (/v3/operators/* and /api/operator_api/v1/*) return 404 or bad gateway errors, indicating a service routing or availability problem rather than an endpoint implementation issue.

## ⚠️ Skip Reason

**This endpoint should be SKIPPED in automated testing.**

Infrastructure issue - the operator management service appears to be unavailable in this test environment. All related endpoints (/v3/operators/* and /api/operator_api/v1/*) return 404 or bad gateway errors, indicating a service routing or availability problem rather than an endpoint implementation issue.

This is typically due to a business constraint where the endpoint works correctly but cannot be tested repeatedly (e.g., one-time operations, unique constraints).
