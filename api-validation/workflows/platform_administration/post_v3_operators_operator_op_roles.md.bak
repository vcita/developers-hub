## ⚠️ Skip Reason

**This endpoint should be SKIPPED in automated testing.**

The endpoint POST /v3/operators/operator_op_roles is documented in swagger but not implemented in the backend. Routes configuration in core/config/routes.rb shows v3 operators namespace only contains operator_tokens endpoint. The OperatorRole model exists, but the REST API endpoints for managing operator role assignments are missing from the routing table.

This is typically due to a business constraint where the endpoint works correctly but cannot be tested repeatedly (e.g., one-time operations, unique constraints).
