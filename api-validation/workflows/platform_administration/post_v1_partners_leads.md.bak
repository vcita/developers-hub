skipReason: Infrastructure issue - Both API gateways (primary and fallback) are returning HTTP 526 'Invalid SSL certificate' errors. This is a server-side SSL configuration problem that cannot be resolved at the API client level. The error indicates that the SSL certificates presented by both api gateways are either expired, invalid, or don't match the domain names. This requires infrastructure team intervention to fix the SSL certificate configuration.

Infrastructure issue - Both API gateways (primary and fallback) are returning HTTP 526 'Invalid SSL certificate' errors. This is a server-side SSL configuration problem that cannot be resolved at the API client level. The error indicates that the SSL certificates presented by both api gateways are either expired, invalid, or don't match the domain names. This requires infrastructure team intervention to fix the SSL certificate configuration.

This is typically due to a business constraint where the endpoint works correctly but cannot be tested repeatedly (e.g., one-time operations, unique constraints).
