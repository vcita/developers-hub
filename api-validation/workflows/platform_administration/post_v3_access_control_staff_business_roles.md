**This endpoint should be SKIPPED in automated testing.**

Staff already has a business role assigned - each staff member can only have one business role assignment. The staff member (guwtwt70kxgic65r) is currently assigned the Administrator role (0396bedc-6194-4e4b-a374-44dec03c7e9a). This is a valid business constraint, not an API error.

This is typically due to a business constraint where the endpoint works correctly but cannot be tested repeatedly (e.g., one-time operations, unique constraints).
