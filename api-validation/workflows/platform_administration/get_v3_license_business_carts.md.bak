User-approved skip: The endpoint is not implemented in the backend. The swagger documentation mentions 'coming soon' but the endpoint returns 404 'Cannot GET' because there's no @Get() route handler in the CartsController.

## ⚠️ Skip Reason

**This endpoint should be SKIPPED in automated testing.**

The endpoint is not implemented in the backend. The swagger documentation mentions 'coming soon' but the endpoint returns 404 'Cannot GET' because there's no @Get() route handler in the CartsController.

This is typically due to a business constraint where the endpoint works correctly but cannot be tested repeatedly (e.g., one-time operations, unique constraints).
