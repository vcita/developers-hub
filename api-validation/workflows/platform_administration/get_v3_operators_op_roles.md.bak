# Get Op roles

## Summary
User-approved skip: Endpoint is documented in swagger but not implemented in the codebase. The routes configuration shows only one operators endpoint under v3: '/operator_tokens', but no op_roles resource. This appears to be a documentation-only endpoint without actual implementation.

## ⚠️ Skip Reason

**This endpoint should be SKIPPED in automated testing.**

Endpoint is documented in swagger but not implemented in the codebase. The routes configuration shows only one operators endpoint under v3: '/operator_tokens', but no op_roles resource. This appears to be a documentation-only endpoint without actual implementation.

This is typically due to a business constraint where the endpoint works correctly but cannot be tested repeatedly (e.g., one-time operations, unique constraints).
