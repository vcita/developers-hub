## ⚠️ Skip Reason

**This endpoint should be SKIPPED in automated testing.**

Infrastructure issue - both primary and fallback API URLs return SSL certificate errors (HTTP 526). The SSL certificates are invalid or expired, preventing any API calls from succeeding. This is not a functional endpoint issue.

This is typically due to a business constraint where the endpoint works correctly but cannot be tested repeatedly (e.g., one-time operations, unique constraints).
